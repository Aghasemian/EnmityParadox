<p align="justify">The "friendship paradox" of social networks states that, on average, "your friends have more friends than you do." Here, we theoretically and empirically explore a related and overlooked paradox we refer to as the "enmity paradox." We use empirical data from 24,678 people living in 176 villages in rural Honduras. We empirically show that, for a real negative undirected network (created by symmetrizing antagonistic interactions), the paradox exists as it does in the positive world. Specifically, a person’s enemies have more enemies, on average, than a person does. Furthermore, in a mixed world of positive and negative ties, we study the conditions for the existence of the paradox, which we refer to as the "mixed-world paradox," both theoretically and empirically, finding that, for instance, a person’s friends typically have more enemies than a person does. We also confirm the "generalized" enmity paradox for non-topological attributes in real data, analogous to the generalized friendship paradox (e.g., the claim that a person’s enemies are richer, on average, than a person is). As a consequence, the naturally occurring variance in the degree distribution of both friendship and antagonism in social networks can skew people’s perceptions of the social world.</p>

    <p align="justify">Histograms of "paradox strengths" ($\delta_g$ and $\delta_l$) for undirected (symmetrized) networks among 176 village networks. The histograms of (pure) enmity and friendship paradoxes are provided in panels A and D, respectively. Other panels represent the histograms of enmity paradox strengths for the mixed worlds. The histogram in panel B shows the global and local paradox distributions for the difference between the number of our enemies and the number of enemies of our friends, while panel C represents the difference between the number of our friends and the number of friends of our enemies.</p>
